Overview
This project focuses on predicting traffic patterns in New York City using time series forecasting techniques, specifically Autocorrelation, ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), and SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA). Accurate traffic prediction is essential for urban planning and transportation management.


Contents
1]traffic_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis for traffic prediction.

2]nyc_traffic_data.csv: The dataset used for this project, containing historical traffic data.

3]nyc_traffic.jpg: An image related to New York City traffic, used for illustration purposes in this README.

Dependencies
To run the code in this repository, you will need the following Python libraries:

*Pandas
*NumPy
*Matplotlib
*Statsmodels
*Scikit-learn 


Usage
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook traffic_prediction.ipynb to explore the code, analysis, and traffic prediction techniques.

The key techniques used in traffic prediction include:

Autocorrelation Analysis: We start by analyzing autocorrelation plots to understand the time series patterns and seasonality.

ARIMA Modeling: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models are employed to capture the temporal dependencies and predict traffic trends.

SARIMA Modeling: Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) models are used to account for seasonality in traffic data.

You can modify the code or experiment with different parameters and techniques to improve traffic prediction accuracy.
